# Toon Island: Aftermath Deployment

Deployment repository for a MMO based off the defunct "Disney's Toontown Online"

# Contributing

As a company, we ***try*** to enforce strict git commit rule(s):

When committing specify what folder you're committing a change to `ex: toontown/dna`

Also in your commit description specify what you hope to accomplish with that code.

Specify whether it's a content addition or fix.

Also do not use vulgar language in any of your commits/messages/descriptions.

Choosing to not follow these rules may result in demotion or complete removal from the staff team.

Minor changes should have [MINOR] before anything and [MAJOR] changes for major changes/fixes.

The Toon Island: Deployment.
